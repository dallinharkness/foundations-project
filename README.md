Welcome to CUBE JUMP!

This is a game I have created to demonstrate my knowledge of code using, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is a game similar to the popular game flappy bird, with my own twist to it! 

The first page is the login page where you would be able to create a username in which you could use for future use as well if you would like to play the game again.

Clicking the play now button brings you to the game. Clicking the boost button allows you to control the white cube and the goal is to stay away from the blue bars. At the top right of the canvas is your score, and the bottom right of the page is a section to submit any comments you have about the game. Below the boost button is the highscore button which allows you to see the all time highscore for your username.

This was my first big project and I really enjoyed it. It has helped mt to really understand how to read code as well as to understand how it works.
